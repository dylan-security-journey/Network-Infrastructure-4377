DNS and WWW started in 1980s

Ethernet is protocol
WWW collection of resources used by network protocols

60-70s: ARPANET
80s-90s-DNS, WWW, AOL, Yahoo, Google
2000s: AWS, GCP, AZURE

Domain Name Service: DNS 

Renting out huge companies services so you don't need in-house infrastructure

Sharing space in cloud, not secure on cloud

Lots of companies bringing data to on-premise

hybrid model for some applications to be on cloud while crucial data on-prem

Infrastructure: Servers, Switches, Storage (Data center)

GCP = google cloud platform

Quantum computing: solving task that would take years in a short span of time

Standard language system = protocols (communication)

LAN: Local Area Network: One office, one rage (backbone network)

MAN: Metropolitan Area Network: Two building's network connected together

WAN: Wide Area Network: Leaving premises and enables global operation network

Topologies describe how devices on a network are related physically and logically (how fast, why, type of firm)

When cables break in topology, connection is lost (Star topology helps isolate connection loss)

Examples: Point-to-Point, Ring, Star (connected with a switch), Mesh (Expensive/Complicated/(24/7 availability)), Bus (Terminators end path), Tree

Intranet: Only business people connect to each other

Extranet: specific people from outside organization have access to your network

OSI Model: Open Systems Interconnect Model (7 layered model)

TCP/IP Model: separed networking functions into discrete layers
