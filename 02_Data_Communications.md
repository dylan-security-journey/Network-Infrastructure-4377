DNS and WWW started in 1980s

Ethernet is protocol
WWW collection of resources used by network protocols

60-70s: ARPANET
80s-90s-DNS, WWW, AOL, Yahoo, Google
2000s: AWS, GCP, AZURE

Domain Name Service: DNS 

Renting out huge companies services so you don't need in-house infrastructure

Sharing space in cloud, not secure on cloud

Lots of companies bringing data to on-premise

hybrid model for some applications to be on cloud while crucial data on-prem

Infrastructure: Servers, Switches, Storage (Data center)

GCP = google cloud platform

Quantum computing: solving task that would take years in a short span of time

Standard language system = protocols (communication)

LAN: Local Area Network: One office, one rage (backbone network)

MAN: Metropolitan Area Network: Two building's network connected together

WAN: Wide Area Network: Leaving premises and enables global operation network

Topologies describe how devices on a network are related physically and logically (how fast, why, type of firm)

When cables break in topology, connection is lost (Star topology helps isolate connection loss)

Examples: Point-to-Point, Ring, Star (connected with a switch), Mesh (Expensive/Complicated/(24/7 availability)), Bus (Terminators end path), Tree

Intranet: Only business people connect to each other

Extranet: specific people from outside organization have access to your network

OSI Model: Open Systems Interconnect Model (7 layered model) theoretical model (Europe usage)

TCP/IP Model: separed networking functions into discrete layers (mostly used)

OSI Layers: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical

Analogy: Please Do Not tell secret password Anyone

TCP/IP Model: Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access

Physical (electrical signal), Data Link (get required info to move), Network (Leave premises to one place to another), Transport (controlling quality of service), Session (ensure connection), Presentation (encryption), Application (UI experience)

Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access

TCP: Telnet/SSH, HTTO

UDP: DNS, SNMP, NTP

Transport: port security, firewalls

Data Link: Switches

How is data encrypted in every single layer

TCP: connection oriented

UDP: connection-less oriented
