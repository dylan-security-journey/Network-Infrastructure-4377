Electrical and machines, cable points: Model transmits digital data bits from source or sending devices

Binary and only understands 0s and 1s

IP address is logical address of machine: ipconfig/all

NIC-Card holds the MAC Address

Default Gateway

Transmission mode is transfer od data between two devices 

Simplex: Data flow is one direction

Guided Media = cable connection (Unshielded & Shielded)

Unguided Media = wireless

Cables twisted fir noise and cross talk cancellation 

CATS are determined by distances (STP cables carry more materials)

Coaxial Cable: deliver high-frequency signals from one point to another with low signal loss (Cable TV)

Fiber Optic: data encoded in pulses of light, can transmit large volumes of data over long distance 

Transceiver allows for fiber optic (converts electrical signal to light signal)

Unbounded media: Azure 2.11 wireless media, Microwave, infrared, satellite, bluetooth, radio waves

Radio waves are type of electromagnetic radiation (Analog & digital signals), the longer the cycle wave the better the penetration of signal 2.4GHZ 5GHZ

Bigger GHz = shorter waves, faster data, but less range.

Smaller GHz = longer waves, more range, but slower speeds.

Multiplexing: sharing of a medium or bandwidth, multiple sources are combines and transmitted over a single physical line (analog signals)

Three types of multiplexing: Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), Wavelength Division Multiplexing (Analog data converted to digital data)

Modulate and Demodualate in frequency divisions multiplexing 

Digital Signals (form of 0s and 1s)

Analog transmission involves continuous waves

Parallel transmission for multiple bits at the same time 

Serial transmission are transferred sequentially

asynchronous clock-wise, syncronous transmission, start and stop bits

Bipolar NRZ voltage is positive or negative, fewer errors than unipolar

Modulator is a converter between analog and digital transmission
